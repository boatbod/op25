=============

This file contains notes on the current OP25 P25 receiver (rx.py) and
multi receiver (multi_rx.py):

EXAMPLE COMMAND LINE
====================
./rx.py  --args 'rtl' --gains 'lna:49' -T tsys.tsv -q -1 -2 -S 1000000 -P symbol -o 50000 -w 2> stderr.2

Running stderr to a file (e.g., "2> stderr.2") is recommended to avoid 
screen misprinting.

NOTE 1: For phase1 voice the "-V" option is not used.  Instead the 
"-w" option is used (see AUDIO SERVER section, below).  For P25 phase 2/TDMA audio decode,
the "-2" option is required in addition to the "-w" option.

NOTE 2: For systems with a TDMA control channel the --tdma-cc option is required

TERMINAL OPERATION
==================
After starting rx.py if plotting is in use a separate gnuplot window
should open.  You must click on the terminal window to restore it to
focus, otherwise all keystrokes are consumed by gnuplot.  Once in the
terminal window there are several keyboard commands:
 B - dynamically add tgid to blacklist
 d - dump list of known tgids to log
 h - hold
 H - hold/goto the specified tgid
 l - lockout
 q - quit program
 s - skip
 v - dynamically change log level
 W - dynamically add tgid to Whitelist
 , - decrease fine tune by 100Hz
 . - increase fine tune by 100Hz
 < - decrease fine tune by 1200Hz
 > - increase fine tune by 1200Hz
 1 - toggle fft plot
 2 - toggle constellation plot (cqpsk)
 3 - toggle symbol plot
 4 - toggle datascope plot
 5 - toggle raw mixer plot
 6 - toggle tuned mixer plot
 <cursor left> / <cursor right> - cycle through avaiable receivers (multi_rx only)

REMOTE TERMINAL
===============
Adding (for example) "-l 56111" to the rx.py command starts rx.py but does
not attach a curses terminal.  Instead the program runs as normal in the
foreground (hit CTRL-C to end rx.py as desired).  To connect to a running 
instance of rx.py, (in this example)
    ./terminal.py 127.0.0.1 56111
NOTE: rx.py and terminal.py need not run on the same machine.  The machine
where terminal.py is running need not have an SDR device directly attached;
but GNU Radio (and OP25) must be available.

WARNING: there is no security or encryption on the UDP port.

EXTERNAL UDP AUDIO SERVER
=========================
Starting rx.py with the "-w -W host" options directs udp audio data to
be sent over the network to the specified remote host.  It can then be
received and played back with either of the following methods:
1. Execute ./audio.sh on a remote machine equipped with python2.7,
   libasound.so.2 and the sockaudio.py file. 
-or-
2. Execute the command: 
   nc -kluvw 1 127.0.0.1 23456 | aplay -c1 -f S16_LE -r 8000
-or-
3. Execute the command:
   vlc.exe --clock-jitter=500 --network-caching=0 --demux=rawaud --rawaud-channels 1 --rawaud-samplerate 8000 udp://@:23456

NOTE: audio underruns are to be expected when using nc | aplay as the
pcm stream is interrupted every time a radio transmission ends.  The
sockaudio player is designed to handle this more gracefully, and generally
only underruns due to high cpu utilization or reception/decoding errors.

INTERNAL AUDIO SERVER
=====================
Starting rx.py with the "-U" command line option enables an internal udp
audio server which will play received audio through the default ALSA
device.  Optionally you may specify which ALSA device to use by setting
the "-O audio_out" option along with "-U".

It is still necessary to specify the "-w" (wireshark) option if using
either the internal or external audio server.

PLOT MODES
==========
Six types of plotting are currently implemented, via the -P parameter:
 * fft
 * constellation
 * symbol
 * datascope
 * mixer
 * fll
The symbol and datascope mode is allowed both in fsk4 and cqpsk modes.
The constellation mode only works when the cqpsk demod mode is selected
(or defaulted).

A couple of notes specific to plot mode:

1. At program startup time the gnuplot window is given the focus after
it opens.  Before you can enter terminal commands you need to click on
the terminal window once to make it the active window.

2. In some cases the gnuplot window is displayed on top of the terminal
window used by OP25.  If so it may be necessary to move one or the other
of the two windows.

HTTP CONSOLE
============
The OP25 dashboard can be made accessible to any web browser over HTTP by 
include the option "-l http:<host>:<port>" when starting the rx.py app,
where <host> is either "127.0.0.1" to limit access from only this host, or
"0.0.0.0" if HTTP access from anywhere is to be allowed*.  After rx.py has
started it begins listening on the specified port for incoming connections.

Once connected the status page should automatically update to show trunking
system status, frequency list, adjacent sites, and other data.

Example:  you have started rx.py with the option "-l http:127.0.0.1:8080".
To connect, set your web browser URL to "http://127.0.0.1:8080".

If one or more plot modes has been selected using the "-P" option you may
view them by clicking the "PLOT" button.  The plots are updated approx.
every five seconds.  Click "STATUS" to return to the main status page.

*WARNING*: there is no security or encryption.  Be careful when using "0.0.0.0"
as the listening address since anyone with access to the network can connect.

MULTI-RECEIVER
==============
The multi_rx.py app allows an arbitrary number of SDR devices and channels
to be defined.  Each channel may have one or more plot windows attached.

Configuration is achieved via a json file (see cfg.json for an example).
In this version, channels are automatically assigned to the first device
found whose frequency span includes the selected frequency.

As of this writing (summer 2020), P25 Trunking and Motorola Smartnet/Smartzone
are fully supported by multi_rx.py.  The rx.py app can still be used for single
receiver P25 trunking.

Below is a summary of the major config file keys used under the channel section:
demod_type:     'cqpsk' for qpsk p25 only
                'fsk4' for ysf/dstar/dmr/fsk4 p25
                'fsk' for Smartnet/Smartzone control channel
filter_type:    'rc' for p25; 'rrc' for dmr and ysf; 'gmsk' for d-star
                'fsk' for Smartnet/Smartzone control channel
                'widepulse' for Smartnet/Smartzone P25CAI voice
plot:           'fft', 'constellation', 'datascope', 'symbol', 'mixer', 'fll'
                [if more than one plot desired, provide a comma-separated list]
destination:    'udp://host:port' or 'file://<filename>'
name:           arbitrary string used to identify channels and devices

Note: DMR audio for the second time slot is sent on the specified port number
plus two.  In the example 'udp://127.0.0.1:56122', audio for the first slot
would use 56122; and 56124 for the second.

The command line options for multi_rx:
Usage: multi_rx.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file=CONFIG_FILE
                        specify config file name
  -v VERBOSITY, --verbosity=VERBOSITY
                        message debug level
  -p, --pause           block on startup

ENCRYPTION
==========
P25 ADP/RC4 (algid 0xAA) decryption with a known key is now supported by both rx.py and multi_rx.py.
See the example configurations: p25_rtl_example.json, p25_conventional_example.json and also the
example json formatting of the keys file: example_keys.json
